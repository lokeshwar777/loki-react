# React Background Color Changer

Welcome to my React project that features a background color changer! This project utilizes React's state management to dynamically change the background color based on user interaction.

## Overview

The `App` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the color state and dynamically applies the background color inline. The color options are presented as buttons, each triggering a different color when clicked.
