# React Props and Tailwind CSS

Welcome to my Tailwind CSS and React project built with Vite! This project explores the integration of Tailwind CSS styles and React components using the Vite build tool.

## Overview

This project includes a simple React component (`Card`) that showcases the usage of Tailwind CSS for styling. The `Card` component code has been adapted from the [DevUI Components](https://www.devui.io/components/cards) library, with due credit to the original source.

Additionally, the main `App` component demonstrates the integration of props in React.
